    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there, i'm Mike Piercey, a recent college graduate with a diploma in Software Development, obtained from the College of the North Atlantic.
        During my time at the college, we specialized in learning Python, JavaScript, Java, and MySQL for databases, amongst other useful courses learning theory.
        Since graduating in August 2024, I have chosen JavaScript as my main language to dive deeper into and learn all I can about modern web technology.
        The 2025 job market has not been kind, but I am not giving up, and I am determined to keep learning all I can until I find my first full-time role as a developer post-graduation.
    </p>
    <h2>Internships</h2>
    <h3>Provincial Aerospace Ltd. (May 2024 - August 2024)</h3>
    <p>
        At Provincial Aerospace Ltd. (PAL), I was one of the two students who were building a website they were developing for a partner company.
        Using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node), my main focus was on building the front-end components, based off of the requirements set by my manager, using Microsoft DevOps as our base of operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Nasdaq Verafin (May 2022 - April 2023)</h3>
    <p>
        During my time at Nasdaq Verafin, I spent my time as a Data Installer on the SMB Ancillary Team, specializing in Automated Clearing House (ACH) data.
        Using AWS architecture, I would download and verify thousands of customer transaction files into a QA environment, and analyze them with SQL queries using PostgreSQL.
        Once accuracy was confirmed, I would configure the importer to ingest all customer files into the production environemnt for data analysis.
